        <h3>Mango Papaya</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Mango Papaya is infamous for its smell and taste that is similar to its tropical fruit counterpart, but an earthy, spicy
        side is also apparent. It creates a flavor that has some bite but is still delicious! Each nug is completely frosted
        with thick chunky white trichomes and has visible droplets of sweet sticky resin. You’ll immediately be hit with a sharp
        sense of energy and focus that is hugely uplifting and motivating. This smooth long-lasting buzz keeps you euphoric and
        creative for hours on end with social tendencies and a feeling of complete relaxation in both the mind and body.
        Anxiety, PTSD, pain, and sleeplessness are no match for Mango Papaya’s potency!
        
        Effects: Happy, Euphoric, Hungry, Uplifted, Relaxed
        
        Flavors: Earthy, Citrus, Spicy</p>

        sleep-promoting effects. Despite a plausible mechanism, it is possible that such claims are merely rooted in cannabis
        lore. The aim of this narrative review was to answer the question: "Is there sufficient clinical evidence to support
        claims that CBN has sleep-promoting effects?" A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE was performed to evaluate the
        published evidence. The abstracts of 99 human studies were screened for relevance by the author and reviewed for
        compliance with the inclusion criteria. The characteristics and principal findings were extracted from eight full-text
        articles that met inclusion criteria for detailed review. Pre-clinical and clinical research investigating the effects
        of CBN is dated and limited, with the preponderance of... Read More</p>
